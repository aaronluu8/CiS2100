Project 1: In project 1, the goal is to create a digital twin for a corporation, in my case - a technology store, using object-oriented Python. I will create many objects to repersent different key components of the corporation. First being product where any information stored in this object will repersent an indvidual product with a name as well as it's price. This object will be able to store multiple different products. The next object will be the order object where a list of products pruchased by customers in a single transaction will be stored. The next object will be the customer object in which the data of the customer will be stored. The Store object will contain records of customers as well as their orders and how many times a customer visited the store in a year. The last object will be the corporation object in which it will store records of all stores throughout the company. I will then intertwine all of the objects to generate one final CSV file.
